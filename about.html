<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Igris — a tech enthusiast from India, currently exploring the world of Full Stack Development. I'm passionate about coding and have been working on projects using Python and web development tools. I'm currently enrolled in Angela Yu's Complete Web Dev Bootcamp and also working on an internship project.</p>

<p>Outside of tech, I'm a huge football fan and a proud supporter of FC Barcelona. Watching matches, analyzing gameplay, and keeping up with my favorite players like Messi and Yamal is something I truly enjoy.</p>

<p>I'm also familiar with C, C++, and Python programming languages and constantly working on improving my skills. Whether it's building something meaningful or diving deep into new technologies, I’m always up for a challenge.</p>
